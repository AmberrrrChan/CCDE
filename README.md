## Cooperative Coevolution
Cooperative Coevolution (CC) framework [1] is a "divide and conquer" based method which is widely used in the field of Large Scale Global Optimization Problem (LSGO). It breaks problem dimension into small sub-problems and evolve them separately. Sub-problem collaboration occurs only during function evaluation.
